# CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python

Artificial Intelligence (AI) encompasses techniques that enable computers to exhibit behaviors that appear intelligent or sentient. AI powers many applications we use daily, such as:

- Recognizing faces in photographs on social media.  
- Defeating world champions in games like chess.  
- Processing speech in virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa.  

This course explores the foundational ideas and techniques that make AI possible:  

## 1. Search
Finding solutions to problems, such as navigating from an origin to a destination or determining the next move in a game.  

- **Uninformed Search:** BFS, DFS  
- **Informed Search:** Greedy Best-First Search, A* Search  
- **Adversarial Search:** Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, Depth-Limited Minimax  
- **Applications:** Maze problem, 15-puzzle, Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, Tic-Tac-Toe  

## 2. Knowledge
- Representing information and reasoning to draw logical inferences.  

## 3. Uncertainty
- Handling uncertain events using probabilistic methods.  

## 4. Optimization
- Identifying not just any solution, but the most efficient or optimal solution to a problem.  

## 5. Learning
- Improving performance over time based on data and experience.  
- Example: Email filters distinguishing spam from non-spam using historical data.  

## 6. Neural Networks
- Computational models inspired by the human brain capable of performing complex tasks effectively.  

## 7. Language
- Understanding and processing natural language, the way humans communicate.
